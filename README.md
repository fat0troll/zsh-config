# ZSH config

This is a ZSH configuration, baked by [Stanislav N. aka pztrn](http://en.pztrn.name/).

## Features

* Fully modular design.
* Ability to write own mini-apps.
* Support libraries support. Just write them and place in 'lib'. Don't forget to source them!
* Same keyboard behaviour across OSes (tested on Linux and FreeBSD).

## Installation

Change your default shell to zsh and make a symlink:

    ln -s /path/to/zsh-config/zshrc ~/.zshrc

Re-login (if you changed your shell) or just restart your terminal app.
